The code defines a React component called List that renders a list of items with selectable items.
The List component accepts an array of items as its input, each item having a text property.

The List component has two child components: SingleListItem and WrappedSingleListItem.
The SingleListItem component renders a single item in the list and is memoized for performance optimization.
The WrappedSingleListItem component is not exported and is used by the SingleListItem component to render a
list item with a text value, an index, a boolean value that indicates whether the item is selected or not,
and an onClick handler.

When a list item is clicked, the handleClick function is called, which updates the selectedIndex state value
with the index of the clicked item. The selected item is highlighted with a green background color.

The List component uses the useState hook to manage the state of the selectedIndex variable, and the useEffect
hook to set the selectedIndex to null whenever the items prop changes. The List component maps over the items
array to render each SingleListItem component with the corresponding text, index, isSelected, and onClickHandler
props. Finally, the List component exports a memoized version of the WrappedListComponent to improve performance
by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
